## About Me
Iâ€™m an MSc graduate in Bioinformatics with strong skills in Python, R, SQL, and data analysis.   
I learn quickly, work hard, and enjoy solving complex problems with efficient, practical solutions.


## Projects Examples

### Python:
* **Cellular Automata Simulation**: Computationally efficient simulation of a a forest fire propagation model, with statistical analysis and visualizations. [GitHub.](https://github.com/sapir-mardan/CellularAutomataFireModel)
  
* **Parallel Subsequence Search**: Efficient parallel algorithm to find the longest contiguous subsequence in genomic data. [GitHub.](https://github.com/sapir-mardan/ParallelSubSearch/tree/main)
  
* **Puffin Classifier:** Fine-tuned ML models for puffin classification, with data analysis and visualizations. [GitHub.](https://github.com/sapir-mardan/PuffinClassifier)

### Genomics:
* **Pathogen Genomic Analysis Toolkit:** An easy-to-use program, based on Python and Bash, to create pipelines that run bioinformatics tasks. It creates BLAST databases, performs searches, and parses results into a user-friendly format to identify and analyze specific genes in any strain. [GitHub.](https://github.com/sapir-mardan/pathogen-genomic-analysis-toolkit)
