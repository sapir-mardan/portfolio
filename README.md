## About Me
MSc student at Bristol University in Bioinformatics. I have expertise in a broad range of bioinformatics methods and tools, proficiency in Python, and experience in designing analysis pipelines, analyzing complex genomic data, R, and Unix/Linux environments.
  
My interest in coding was sparked during my bachelor's studies, where I discovered the power of programming to unravel the mysteries of life. What started as a hobby grew into a passion for learning new techniques and solving problems in the most efficient way. I am enthusiastic about further developing my skills and contributing my expertise to cutting-edge research.


## Projects Examples

### Python:
* **Cellular Automata Simulation**: Computationally efficient simulation of a a forest fire propagation model, with statistical analysis and visualizations. [GitHub.](https://github.com/sapir-mardan/CellularAutomataFireModel)
  
* **Parallel Subsequence Search**: Efficient parallel algorithm to find the longest contiguous subsequence in genomic data. [GitHub.](https://github.com/sapir-mardan/ParallelSubSearch/tree/main)
  
* **Puffin Classifier:** Fine-tuned ML models for puffin classification, with data analysis and visualizations. [GitHub.](https://github.com/sapir-mardan/PuffinClassifier)

### Genomics:
* **Pathogen Genomic Analysis Toolkit:** An easy-to-use program, based on Python and Bash, to create pipelines that run bioinformatics tasks. It creates BLAST databases, performs searches, and parses results into a user-friendly format to identify and analyze specific genes in any strain.
