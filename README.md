## About Me
Current Bioinformatics MSc student with experience in analyzing complex genomic data. I have expertise in a broad range of bioinformatics methods and tools, including proficiency in Python, and experience in designing analysis pipelines, R, Unix/Linux environments and various bioinformatics tools.  
  
My interest in coding was sparked during my bachelor's studies, where I discovered the power of programming to unravel the mysteries of life. What started as a hobby grew into a passion for learning new techniques and solving problems in the most efficient way. I am enthusiastic about further developing my skills and contributing my expertise to cutting-edge research.


## Projects Examples

### Python:
* **Cellular Automata Simulation**: Implemented a computationally efficient simulation of a a forest fire propagation model, conducted statistical analysis of stable state conditions, and visualized insights. [Link to GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/sapir-mardan/CellularAutomataFireModel)
  
* **Parallel Subsequence Search**: Algorithmic design to find the longest subsequence in genomic data, enhancing efficiency with parallel processing. [Link to GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/sapir-mardan/ParallelSubSearch/tree/main)
  
* **Puffin Classifier:** The project emphasizes machine learning, model selection and data visualization to classify puffin species. [Link to GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/sapir-mardan/PuffinClassifier)

### Genomics:
* **Pathogen Genomic Analysis Toolkit:** Pipeline designed as an easy-to-use interface, integrates seamlessly Python and Bash scripts to run bioinformatics tasks.
  The program creates BLAST database, performs BLAST searches, parse the results to an output in a user-friendly format which can help identify and analyze specific genes of interest in any strain. [Link to GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sapir-mardan/pathogen-genomic-analysis-toolkit).
