## About Me
Current Bioinformatics MSc student with experience in analyzing complex genomic data. I have expertise in a broad range of bioinformatics methods and tools, including proficiency in Python and R for scientific programming, and experience in designing analysis pipelines.


## Projects Examples

### Python:
* **Cellular Automata Simulation**: Implemented a computationally efficient simulation of a a forest fire propagation model, conducted statistical analysis of stable state conditions, and visualized insights.[Link to GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/sapir-mardan/CellularAutomataFireModel)
  
* **Parallel Subsequence Search**: Algorithmic design to find the longest subsequence in genomic data, enhancing efficiency with parallel processing.[Link to GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/sapir-mardan/ParallelSubSearch/tree/main)
  
* **Puffin Classifier:** The project emphasizes machine learning, model selection and data visualization to classify puffin species. [Link to GitHub Repository.](https://github.com/sapir-mardan/PuffinClassifier)
