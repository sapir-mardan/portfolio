title: "Forest Fire Simulation â€“ Python Model with Parallelised Performance & Data Visualisation"
date: 2025-02-01
---

In this project, I built a **computational simulation** to model forest fire propagation.  
The focus was on **performance optimisation** using parallelised computation, and on 
visualising data to explore how variables like wind speed and density affect fire spread.

## Methods
The simulation was written in Python, using NumPy for data handling and Matplotlib for visualisation.  
Parallelisation was achieved through multiprocessing, reducing runtime by over 70%.

## Results
Visualisations helped identify clear propagation patterns and performance improvements.  
This project strengthened my skills in **data analysis, algorithm design, and efficient Python scripting.**
